# RED AUTUMN: MALAYA–SINGAPORE (1947–1965)

A browser-based political strategy game inspired by **Red Autumn SPD**, set in an alternate-timeline Singapore and Malaya where:

- Communism never existed  
- Marxism never emerged  
- The Cold War never happened  
- The Labour Front becomes the **NSSWP** in 1953  
- PKMM + MCA form a united Malay–Chinese socialist bloc  
- UMNO becomes an authoritarian ethno-nationalist antagonist  
- Singapore transitions into a **National Socialist Republic** (NSRS)

This game simulates the political crisis, coalition-building, mass mobilization, and governance struggles during:

- Malaya (1947–1951)  
- Singapore (1947–1953)  
- NSRS Singapore (1953–1965)
